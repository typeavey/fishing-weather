# 🔐 Security & Privacy Guide

## 🚨 Sensitive Data Protection

This document outlines the security measures in place to protect sensitive information in the Fishing Weather Website.

## 🔑 API Keys & Credentials

### What's Protected
- **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: Stored as environment variable `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
- **Database credentials**: SQLite databases (no external credentials needed)
- **Server configuration**: Apache `.htaccess` files

### What's NOT in Git
- ✅ No hardcoded API keys
- ✅ No database passwords
- ✅ No server credentials
- ✅ No personal information

## 📁 Files Excluded from Version Control

### Sensitive Data Files
```
.env*                    # Environment variables
*api_key*               # API key files
*secret*                # Secret files
*password*              # Password files
*credential*            # Credential files
config.ini              # Configuration with secrets
secrets.json            # JSON secrets
credentials.json        # Credential files
```

### Database & Data Files
```
sqlite_db/*.db          # SQLite databases
*.csv                   # Data exports
*.json                  # Data files
data_export/            # Data export directory
backups/                # Backup files
```

### Log Files
```
*.log                   # All log files
logs/                   # Log directory
~/logs/                 # User log directory
```

### Development Files
```
__pycache__/            # Python cache
*.pyc                   # Compiled Python
venv/                   # Virtual environments
.env/                   # Environment directories
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Set API key (never commit this)
export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY='your_actual_api_key'

# Add to ~/.bashrc for persistence
echo 'export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Database Security
- SQLite databases are local only
- No external database connections
- Database files are excluded from git

### 3. API Key Management
- API keys are loaded from environment variables
- No hardcoded keys in source code
- Scripts check for key presence before running

### 4. File Permissions
- Sensitive files have restricted permissions
- Log files are readable only by owner
- Database files are protected

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Never commit `.env` files
- ❌ Never hardcode API keys
- ❌ Never commit database files
- ❌ Never commit log files
- ❌ Never commit backup files

## ✅ What IS Safe to Commit

- ✅ Source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python)
- ✅ Configuration templates
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ README files
- ✅ License files

## 🔍 Security Checklist

Before committing code, ensure:
- [ ] No API keys are hardcoded
- [ ] No database files are included
- [ ] No log files are included
- [ ] No `.env` files are included
- [ ] No backup files are included
- [ ] No sensitive configuration is exposed

## 📞 Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **DO NOT** commit the fix to a public repository
2. Contact the system administrator immediately
3. Document the issue privately
4. Test the fix thoroughly before deployment

## 🔐 Current Security Status

- ✅ API keys are environment-based
- ✅ Database files are gitignored
- ✅ Log files are gitignored
- ✅ Sensitive configs are gitignored
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets found
- ✅ Proper file permissions set
